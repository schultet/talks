# What is this repository for? #

This is a Go tutorial for the `Oberseminar 2017 (Freiburg)`. The repository 
contains slides (*.slide file(s)). The sample source code used on the slides can
be found in ./src. Exercises (and their solutions) are located in ./exercises.

To view the slides, go tool `present` must be installed. After installation, 
just run `present` from within the folder containing the .slide file(s).

To install `present` use go get (within a shell):

```shell
$ go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/present
```

(Obviously, Go tools (compiler, get, etc.) must be installed for this.)
